List
Set
Queue

three data structure come from collection interface

    collection				  {for CRUD operations}
List   Set    Queue   		  { all are interfaces }

all CRUD function are just declared in collection

for index wise working List is used

            List
ArrayList  Vector   LinkedList	

Arraylist is not synchronous and vector is synchronous so only one can work in multi threading


Set is not to show duplicate data as it is a binary search tree inside 

Priority Queue is under Queue  

LinkedList implements Queue as well as List

In java linked list is doubly linked list from inside and further can be used as desired
