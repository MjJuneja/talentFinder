Servlet is a simple java program which run iside a container. Container is TomCat here.
At the same time tomcat use JRE. syntax here will be of servlet which will understand it and use JRE to run it.

For servlet we need a library to run as it is not a part of JDK.
in core we were using JSE java standard edition now we are using enterprise edition


   Earlier our java class didnt run on server as it lacked API  ... JSP lack these API ( java server pages)
   
   Servlet contains these api
   
   servlet convert it in web version
    Component
 Servlet	JSP
 
 
 Container --> deploy the component
 
 
			on creating new servlet it ask toget and topost   toget is for getting data and topost to submit data
			
			
			
printStream ps = new PrintStream(new File(path));

System.setOut(ps);
Sytem.out.println("hey");  // print on file now
