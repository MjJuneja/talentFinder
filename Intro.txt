J2EE -java enterprise edition.  now known as JEE

Requirement for JEE apps

     1.) Container : Run time environment or like JRE..this plays application on server. runs byte code and convert it in html code to open it on browser
	      a.) Component: Servlet and JSP are running inside it.  {Servlet is the main and JSP is its wrapper and Struts is wrapper of JSP and servlet}
		                 servlet came in market in 1997. Struts came in market in 2000 and v2.0 came in 2004.
		  b.) Service : eg. "Multi threading"		  
		  
		  c.) Security: Data travel on net in secured manner. {https can be done by doing changes in configuration}
		                https provide secured routes for package of data and encryption takes place.
						http problem is that it is connection less network as it cuts the network when connected so to remember we use Persistence
			
          d.) Persistence : to remember clients that server has to remember.	

JEE complience container help operating it.

any server that follows JEE guidelines can be used as JEE complience server.
eg.-   Tomcat {most used} Web Server, powerful
       Weblogic
       WebSphere
       Jetty   Web Server,light
       JBoss {2nd most}  EJV Container
       Oracle App Server
       Glass Fish	   
	   
	   
	   Web Server means onle JSP and Servlet works on them
	   Web Server has web container that can operate JSP and Servlet
	   
	   JBoss and other based on EJV Container where logic can be uploaded on server. So that same logic can be hosted on server and can be used
	   with different applications like web, android, Swing or nay other possible. It is most secured
		
		One containing both are called application server eg. JBoss
		
		
		
Eclipse follows

Project --> Web-INF --> Class --> *.class(Byte Code)
              |
